  ## **Installation**

  To install the README Generator, you can clone the code from my GitHub repository. After cloning the code simply install the packages from the package.json file.  This program only uses inquirer.

  ## **Usage**

  To use the project simply run 'node index' on the command line after installing the correct dependencies.  Answer the question prompts and you're done!  A new professional README will be created in the 'dist' directory

  ## **Contributing**

  If you wish to contribute to this project, create a fork of my repository on GitHub. Then when you have made your changes create a merge request and I will look into adding your code as soon as I can.

  ## **Testing**

  Some tests you could try out would be checking if there is input validation for the inquirer.prompt questions and after the README is generated see if the links function correctly.
